# Resistance in a Wire model

This document describes the model for the Resistance in a Wire simulation.<br>

The model describes the resistance of a straight ohmic wire. The resistance (in Ohms) is proportional to the
resistivity (in Ohm-cm) and length (cm) of the wire. The resistance is also inversely proportional to the cross section
of the wire (in cm^2). In equation form R = œÅL/A or Resistance = ( Resistivity * Length ) / Area
